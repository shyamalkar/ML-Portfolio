Titanic survival prediction | Machine learning portfolio project

🙏🏼 Welcome to my machine learning portfolio!  
This project focuses on predicting passenger survival in the Titanic disaster using a real world data set . It demonstrates an (end to start ML workflow:) from data cleaning to model evaluation.

1) Project overview 

🎯 i) Goal: Predict whether a passenger survuved based on features like age, gender, and class
📚 ii) Algorithm used: Logistics Regression(Scikit-learn)
 0 iii) Accuracy Achieved: ~81%

⭐️ Bouns trip

🎬 If you'are a beginer in ML, this project is a greate place to start. 
you can use this notebook as a (template) for future dataset . For example (Breast cancer, or House prices) and etc.
